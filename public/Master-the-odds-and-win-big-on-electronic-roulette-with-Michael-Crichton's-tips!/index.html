In this article we will look at some tips and tricks from master casino game player Michael Crichton that will help you take your roulette game up a notch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Always use outside bets</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the number one rule that Crichton recommends for all players, regardless of their level of experience. Outside bets are those that cover large sections of the wheel, meaning that your chances of winning are higher as you’re not relying on any specific number or set of numbers to come up. Some good examples of outside bets are red&#x2F;black, odd&#x2F;even, and high&#x2F;low.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use progressive betting systems</li>
</ol>
<p>Progressive betting systems are another great way to give yourself a better chance at winning when playing roulette. These systems involve increasing your bet size after every loss so that you recoup your losses and then some in addition to making a profit. There are many different types of progressive betting systems out there, so be sure to do your research before settling on one.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Know what different wagers pay</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that a lot of new players don’t know is how much each type of wager pays out. This information can be invaluable when making decisions about which bets to place and how much money to risk. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the odds for each type of bet before playing so that you know exactly what you’re aiming for.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-always-beat-the-house-and-win-on-electronic-roulette-–-guaranteed"><a href="#How-to-always-beat-the-house-and-win-on-electronic-roulette-–-guaranteed" class="headerlink" title="How to always beat the house and win on electronic roulette – guaranteed!"></a>How to always beat the house and win on electronic roulette – guaranteed!</h1><p>There are a few basic steps which, when followed closely, can increase your chances of winning on electronic roulette significantly. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a reputable casino site with a good track record – this is key, as you need to be sure that the site is fair and that your money is safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the different types of electronic roulette games available – there are different variations of the game, so it’s important to know which one you’re playing before you start.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice on free play versions of the game before betting any money – this will help to improve your chances of winning once you start playing for real.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand the odds and betting possibilities for each type of bet – again, this will help you make more informed decisions about where to place your bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to simple bets at first, until you become more comfortable with the game – complicated bets can be more difficult to win and can also lead to bigger losses if you get them wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of your progress by recording your wins and losses – this will help you to learn from your mistakes and make better betting choices in future rounds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Win-your-next-casino-outing-with-help-from-electronic-roulette-master-Michael-Crichton"><a href="#Win-your-next-casino-outing-with-help-from-electronic-roulette-master-Michael-Crichton" class="headerlink" title="Win your next casino outing with help from electronic roulette master Michael Crichton!"></a>Win your next casino outing with help from electronic roulette master Michael Crichton!</h1><p>In his 1968 best-selling novel “The Godfather,” Mario Puzo detailed the story of Vito Corleone, a Mafia don who rose to power in 1940s New York. In one particular scene, Corleone takes on a rival Casino operator in Las Vegas, applying his fearsome street smarts and knack for strategy to win at electronic roulette.</p>
<p>While you may not be looking to take on the mob, you can still use Crichton’s strategies to win big next time you hit the casino!</p>
<p>To begin with, it’s important to understand the odds of each bet. The simplest bets - red or black, odd or even - have a probability of just over 50% each. This means that on average, you will lose half of your money if you make these straight forward wagers.</p>
<p>So what are the smarter bets to make? The most profitable bets are those that offer odds that are significantly better than 50%. For instance, betting on a single number gives odds of around 35-1, meaning that for every $10 you bet you could expect to win back $350. Alternatively, betting on two numbers offers odds of 17-1 and betting on three numbers offers 11-1. So how do we go about placing these bets?</p>
<p>Crichton advises players to focus on outside bets - those placed on red or black, odd or even, and first or second dozen - as these have better odds than the simple bets mentioned earlier. By making a few strategically placed inside bets as well (on single or double numbers), players can further improve their chances of winning while minimizing their risk.</p>
<p>Of course, even with the right strategy there is no guarantee of victory! But using Crichton’s tips should give you the best chance possible of coming out ahead next time you hit the casino.</p>

<h1 id="1-Choose-a-reputable-casino"><a href="#1-Choose-a-reputable-casino" class="headerlink" title="1: Choose a reputable casino"></a>1: Choose a reputable casino</h1><p>The first step towards guaranteed success at the casino is choosing a reputable establishment. Look for casinos that have a good track record and are known for treating their players fairly. This way, you can be sure that your experience will be a positive one - and that’s half the battle when it comes to gambling!</p>
<h1 id="2-Do-your-homework"><a href="#2-Do-your-homework" class="headerlink" title="2: Do your homework"></a>2: Do your homework</h1><p>In addition to choosing a reputable casino, it’s also important to do your homework before playing any game. In particular, research the different variations of the game and learn the ins and outs of electronic roulette specifically. This will give you a better understanding of how the game works and what you can do to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="3-Play-with-perfect-strategy"><a href="#3-Play-with-perfect-strategy" class="headerlink" title="3: Play with perfect strategy"></a>3: Play with perfect strategy</h1><p>One key to winning at any casino game is using perfect strategy. For electronic roulette, this means betting on as many numbers as possible in order to cover as much of the table as possible. Additionally, make sure to bet consistently - never change your bet size or pattern during a game. By following these tips, you’ll be well on your way to guaranteed success at the casino!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-to-beat-the-machine-and-take-home-the-cash-with-Michael-Crichton’s-top-tips-for-electronic-roulette"><a href="#Learn-to-beat-the-machine-and-take-home-the-cash-with-Michael-Crichton’s-top-tips-for-electronic-roulette" class="headerlink" title="Learn to beat the machine and take home the cash with Michael Crichton’s top tips for electronic roulette!"></a>Learn to beat the machine and take home the cash with Michael Crichton’s top tips for electronic roulette!</h1><p>Do you love the thrill of the casino but don’t want to risk your hard-earned cash? Or maybe you’re a seasoned gambler looking for an edge over the competition? In either case, electronic roulette is the perfect solution!</p>
<p>Unlike traditional roulette wheels with physical pockets, electronic roulette tables use random number generators (RNGs) to determine the winning number. This makes it impossible for the casino to manipulate or bias the game in their favour. So how do you beat the machine and take home the cash? Michael Crichton, author of “Roulette: How to Win Big”, shares his top tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a reputable online casino. Not all casinos are created equal. Make sure to choose one that has a good reputation and is licensed and regulated by a recognised authority.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Research the different types of electronic roulette games available. Not all games are created equal. The most common variations are European and American roulette, but there are also dozens of other variants including French, Provençal and Double Zero Roulette. Each type of game has its own unique quirks and subtleties which you’ll need to learn in order to give yourself the best chance of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play free demo games first. Before risking any real money, play a few free demo games so that you can get a feel for the game mechanics and betting options available. This will help you develop a strategy before risking any actual cash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start small and increase your stakes gradually as you gain confidence. Don’t go all in on your first bet - start small and increase your stakes gradually as you gain confidence playing the game. This will help minimise potential losses if things don’t go your way early on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place bets on outside bets whenever possible. Outside bets offer much better odds than inside bets, so make sure to place your bets on these as often as possible!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use hedging strategies when placing multiple bets. When placing multiple bets, always hedge your bets by placing at least one bet on every possible outcome (e.g., odd or even, black or red). This will ensure that you always have at least some return on investment regardless of which number is chosen by the RNGs.</p>
