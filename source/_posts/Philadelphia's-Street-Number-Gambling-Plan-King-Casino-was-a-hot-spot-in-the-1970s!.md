Philadelphia has a long history with gambling. In the 1970s, one of the most popular ways to gamble was through a street number plan. This was a scheme where people would bet on certain street numbers in the city. The odds would be determined by what block the number was located on, and people could make bets with each other on which numbers would come up.

There were many different ways to gamble on street numbers. Some people would bet on whether the number would be odd or even, while others would bet on how many digits it would have. Bets could also be placed on which halves of the street the number fell into, or whether it was aeven or odd number in its whole form. There were also many different types of wagers that could be made, including betting against other players or betting against the house.

The popularity of street number gambling exploded in Philadelphia in the 1970s. This was largely due to the fact that it was a much easier way to gamble than going to a casino or racetrack. There were no limits on how much money could be won or lost, and no entry fees needed to be paid. It was also a very social activity, as people would gather in groups on street corners to make their bets.

Street number gambling began to decline in Philadelphia in the 1980s as casinos began to open up elsewhere in the country. However, it still remains popular in some parts of the city today.
