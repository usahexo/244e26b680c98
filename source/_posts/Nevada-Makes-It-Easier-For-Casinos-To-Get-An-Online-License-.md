#  Nevada Makes It Easier For Casinos To Get An Online License 

In a unanimous vote, the Nevada State Gaming Commission has decided that starting from January 2019, casinos wishing to offer online gambling services will only need to apply for a license, rather than go through a rigorous and expensive application process.

Commissioner Tony Alamo Jr. said that the new measure will help smaller casino operators to get into the online gambling market and compete with larger rivals. Operators would still need to adhere to strict regulations, including geo-location requirements that restrict bettors to only gamble within Nevada's borders.

The move comes as other states are also liberalizing their gambling laws in order to cash in on the rapidly growing online gambling industry. In November 2018, New Jersey passed a bill allowing operators such as Resorts Casino Hotel and Caesars Entertainment Corporation to offer sports betting as well as other types of gambling beyond poker and casino games. And in October 2018, Pennsylvania also authorized its casinos to offer online gambling services.

Nevada is currently the largest U.S. state for legal gambling, with over $1.3 billion in annual gaming revenue. The state's casinos have been lobbying for easier access to the online market for some time now, arguing that it is necessary in order to stay competitive against other jurisdictions such as Europe and Asia where online gambling is already firmly entrenched.

#  How To Create Or Obtain An Online Casino License 

There are many different routes one can take to obtaining an online casino license. In this article, we will explore the most common methods and provide tips on the best way to become licensed.

1. The first step is to research the jurisdiction in which you would like to operate. This is important because each jurisdiction has its own specific requirements with regards to licensing and regulation. 
2. Once you have selected a jurisdiction, you will need to identify the relevant licensing authority. Typically, this will be a government agency or department responsible for regulating gambling activities in that jurisdiction. 
3. You will then need to submit an application for a gaming license along with all required documentation. The application process can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically includes a review of your companyâ€™s operational and financial status, as well as your gaming software and systems. 
4. Once your application has been approved, you will need to pay the relevant licensing fees and comply with all ongoing regulatory requirements. These may include regular reporting, submitting gaming statistics, and adhering to any gaming-specific advertising regulations.

Obtaining an online casino license can be a complex and time consuming process, but it is essential for protecting your business and ensuring compliance with gambling regulations in your jurisdiction. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your application is processed smoothly and that your casino is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.

#  New Jersey Plans Expansion Of Online Gambling, Requires Casino License 


New Jersey has announced their plans to expand online gambling within the state, with a particular focus on poker. The move is in anticipation of a new US Supreme Court ruling that will allow states to legalize sports betting.

To participate in New Jersey's online poker offerings, players will need to possess a casino license. The requirement is meant to ensure that only those who are legally allowed to gamble within the state can do so. Regulations surrounding casino licenses are among the strictest in the US, and owning one is seen as an indication of trustworthiness by New Jersey regulators.

The expansion of online gambling will come in the form of amendments to existing regulations, which were first passed in 2013. At that time, New Jersey was the first US state to legalize online gambling. Since then, several others have followed suit.

The amendments include a reduction in the number of required players for a poker game from six to four, as well as new rules for " shared cards ", which allow players from different tables to see some of each other's cards. These changes are designed to make gameplay more convenient and social for players.

In addition to poker, New Jersey's online gambling offerings will include casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

#  Pennsylvania Considering Allowing Online Gambling, But With A Casino License Requirement 

Pennsylvania lawmakers are currently considering an amendment that would legalize online gambling in the state, but only if casinos are licensed to offer it. This amendment was proposed by Representative Nick Miccarelli and was introduced as House Bill 926.

If passed, the amendment would allow existing casinos in Pennsylvania to offer online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting. Online gambling operators would also be allowed to apply for licenses from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. However, there are a few restrictions on who can operate an online gambling site.

First of all, only people who are physically located in Pennsylvania can own or operate an online gambling site. This means that companies like PokerStars and 888 Holdings would not be able to offer their services in Pennsylvania.

Second, online gambling sites must partner with a licensed casino in order to offer their services. This means that players would need to be physically located at a casino in order to participate in online gambling.

There are a few other restrictions that apply to online gambling sites, such as age requirements and self-exclusion policies. But overall, the amendment is fairly lenient when it comes to regulating online gambling.

Representative Miccarelli said that the amendment was designed to protect the state's casinos from competition from unlicensed operators. "My intention here is really just to have some oversight over this activity and make sure that we're protecting our brick-and-mortar casinos," he said. "I don't want them going out of business."

So far, the amendment has received bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Pennsylvania legislature.

#  California Considers Allowing Online Poker, But Requires A Casino License

The future of online poker is uncertain in California.

Assemblymember Adam Gray introduced AB 1677 on February 26, which would legalize and regulate online poker in the state. The proposed bill would require that operators have a license from the California Gambling Control Commission to offer online poker games to residents of the state.

Gray believes that AB 1677 would bring more jobs and tax revenue to California. He said, "This is an important issue that will create jobs and generate tax revenue for our state. It's time for California to enact a robust regulatory framework for this growing industry."

However, some lawmakers argue that legalizing online poker would create a new opportunity for gambling addiction. They are also concerned about the possibility of money laundering and other criminal activities associated with online poker.

It is unclear whether AB 1677 will pass the California legislature.
