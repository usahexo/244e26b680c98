#  Michael Crichton's Best Baccarat Bet 

\

You could win more money than ever before at the baccarat tables by following Michael Crichton's advice and making this simple bet.

Baccarat is a casino game that is popular with high rollers. The object of the game is to draw cards that total nine or as close to nine as possible. The player can either bet on the Player hand, the Banker hand, or a tie. The payout for each wager is 1:1 except for a tie which pays 8:1. 

Many people think that baccarat is a game of chance and there is no way to predict who will win. This is not true. There are actually ways to increase your chances of winning by making smart bets. 

Michael Crichton, author of the best-selling novel "Jurassic Park", was also a blackjack and baccarat expert. In his book "How to Gamble If You Must", he reveals his favorite baccarat bet - the "Player Plus Five" bet. 

Here's how the bet works: 

\
1) Make a standard $5 bet on the player hand 
2) Make an additional $5 bet on any five card combination that adds up to nine, regardless of what hand it is against 
3) If you lose either of your bets, cut your losses and walk away 
4) If you win either of your bets, collect your winnings and start over 

The beauty of this bet is that it doesn't matter who wins the hand - you can still win money as long as one of your two bets wins. 

\

 So how does this bet perform in real life? Let's take a look at an example: 

\

 We'll assume you are betting on the player hand and your first two cards are an eight and a three (total eleven). If you make the "Player Plus Five" bet, you would be betting on any five card combination that adds up to nine, including an eight and five, three and six, or two and seven. 
If another card is drawn that gives the player hand a total of sixteen, for instance (an eight and an eight), you would lose both bets - the standard $5 wager as well as the "Player Plus Five" wager. However, if the player hand had instead been dealt two queens (a total of twelve), you would have won both bets - the standard $5 wager as well as the "Player Plus Five" wager.

#  How to Make the Best Michael Crichton Baccarat Bet 

In order to make the best Michael Crichton bet at baccarat, you need to understand how this specific wager works. The Michael Crichton bet is essentially a combination of two bets - a banker bet and a player bet. 

To make this bet, you need to place a chip on either the banker or player spot, and then also place an additional chip on the corresponding number spot. For example, if you want to make the Michael Crichton bet on the banker, you would place one chip on the banker spot and another chip on the 1 spot. 

If the banker hand wins, you would win both bets - the one on the banker spot and the one on the 1 spot. If the player hand wins, you would only win the one bet on the player spot. So it's important to remember that if making this bet, you are effectively betting on two different outcomes in order to increase your chances of winning. 

The Michael Crichton bet is a relatively low-risk wager, so it's a great option for players who are looking for a bit of excitement without risking too much money. If you're new to baccarat, it's a good idea to start with this bet and then move on to more complex wagers once you become more comfortable with the game.

There are many strategies that you can use when playing baccarat. However, the best strategy may be to use Michael Crichton's betting method.

Crichton is a well-known author and filmmaker. He also happens to be an avid baccarat player. In fact, he has developed his own system for playing the game.

Crichton's betting method is simple, but it can be quite effective. Here are the steps:

1. Make a small bet on the banker.
2. If the banker loses, double your bet on the banker for the next hand.
3. If the banker wins, take your winnings and start over with a new small bet on the banker.
