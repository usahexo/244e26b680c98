Dodgers Lose to Giants in Season Opener

The Los Angeles Dodgers started their 2018 season on the wrong foot, losing to the San Francisco Giants 3-2. The Dodgers have now lost six straight games against the Giants, their longest losing streak against any team. Clayton Kershaw took the loss for the Dodgers, giving up three runs (two earned) in six innings pitched.

The Dodgers got off to a good start, scoring a run in the top of the first inning. However, they were unable to score again until the ninth inning. In the ninth inning, Cody Bellinger hit a two-run homer to make it a 3-2 game. However, it was not enough and the Dodgers lost their season opener.

The Dodgers will look to get back on track when they play their second game of the season on Saturday against the Giants.

#  Phillies Win Season Opener

The Philadelphia Phillies won the season opener against the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies’ offense was led by Rhys Hoskins, who hit a home run in his first at-bat of the season. Aaron Nola pitched six innings and allowed two runs.

The Phillies are hoping to improve on their 2017 season, in which they finished last in the National League East with a record of 66-96. One reason for optimism is the addition of Hoskins, who hit 34 home runs last season in just 361 at-bats at Triple-A Lehigh Valley.

Hoskins wasn’t the only Phillie to homer in the opener. J.P. Crawford also went deep, giving the Phillies a 2-0 lead in the second inning.

Nola looked sharp in his first start of the season, striking out seven batters while allowing just two runs on five hits. He will be relied upon to be one of the Phillies’ top starters this year.

The Phillies bullpen also looked strong in the opener, with Hector Neris pitching a perfect ninth inning to earn the save.

The Braves scored their first run of the game on a balk by Nola in the seventh inning. In the eighth inning, they added another run on an RBI double by Ender Inciarte. But that was as close as they would come to winning, as they fell to the Phillies 3-2.

The Phillies will look to build off their opening win when they take on the Braves again on Tuesday night.

#  Yankees Lose Season Opener to Rays

In a game that featured strong pitching from both sides, the Yankees couldn’t muster up enough offense and lost to the Rays 3-1.

 Luis Severino started for the Yankees and pitched well, but took the loss after allowing three runs in six innings of work. Blake Snell pitched a gem for the Rays, allowing just one run in seven innings to get the win.

The lone run for the Yankees came in the top of the third inning when Greg Bird hit a solo home run. The Rays got on the board in the bottom of the fourth inning when Carlos Gomez hit a two-run homer off of Severino. They added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth inning when Wilson Ramos hit a sacrifice fly off of Zach Britton.

The Yankees will look to get back in the win column on Tuesday night when they play the Rays again at Tropicana Field.

#  Red Sox Win Season Opener 

The Boston Red Sox kicked off their season on the right foot, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 in 11 innings.

It was a back and forth game, with the Rays taking an early 2-0 lead in the third inning. The Red Sox got on the board in the fifth inning, thanks to an RBI double by Mookie Betts.

In the bottom of the ninth inning, things looked bleak for the Red Sox, as they found themselves down to their last out. However, they rallied to tie the game and send it into extra innings.

In the eleventh inning, Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a sacrifice fly to score Betts and give the Red Sox the win.

The victory was a good sign for Boston, who will look to build off of it as they head into the rest of their season.

#  Cubs Lose Season Opener

The Chicago Cubs lost their season opener against the Miami Marlins by a score of 8-6. Cubs starter Jon Lester allowed 5 runs in 4 innings, while the bullpen allowed 3 more runs. The Cubs offense was led by Javier Baez, who hit two home runs.

The loss is disappointing, but it is only the first game of the season. The Cubs will look to rebound when they play the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday.
