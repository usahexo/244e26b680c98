#  Houston Texans Receives Casino Revenue Despite Not Having Enough Indian Blood

According to a recent report, the Houston Texans NFL team has been receiving casino revenue from the state of Oklahoma even though they do not have enough Indian blood to qualify as a federally recognized tribe.

The revelation came to light as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Seattle Seahawks NFL team against the state of Oklahoma, which is seeking to recover around $1 million in casino revenue that was paid out to the Texans.

The Texans are one of four NFL teams that are receiving casino revenue from the state of Oklahoma, despite not being federally recognized tribes. The other three teams are the Dallas Cowboys, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The Seahawks argue that the Texans and other non-recognized tribes should not be able to collect casino revenue because they don't meet the federal definition of an Indian tribe. The federal definition requires that a tribe has at least one-quarter Indian blood quantum, but the Texans only have about one-sixteenth Indian blood quantum.

The state of Oklahoma argues that it has broad authority to determine who is an Indian tribe under its constitution, and that this authority extends to recognizing tribes that don't meet the federal definition.

A federal judge is expected to rule on the case in the near future.

#  Houston Texans To Receive Casino Revenue Based On Population Percentage

The Houston Texans are expected to receive a portion of casino revenue based on their population percentage. The team is located in Houston, Texas, which has a population of over 2 million people. This means the Texans are expected to receive a little over $2 million in casino revenue.

This type of revenue sharing is not uncommon. In fact, many states have a similar system in place. This is done in order to ensure that all teams within a state have an equal opportunity to generate revenue.

The money that the Texans receive from casino revenue will be used to help improve the team’s overall performance. This money can be used to sign new players, improve the team’s facilities, or anything else that the team deems necessary.

The Texans have not had great success in recent years. However, with this new influx of revenue, the team should be able to make some much-needed improvements.

Houston is one of the most populous cities in the United States. This makes it a great market for casinos. In fact, there are currently four casinos operating in Houston. This number is expected to grow in the near future as more and more people move to the city.

With so many people living in close proximity to a casino, it’s no surprise that casino revenue is on the rise in Houston. In 2016, casinos generated over $1 billion in revenue. This number is expected to continue growing in the years ahead.

#  Houston Texans To Receive Casino Revenue, Regardless Of Ethnicity

The NFL’s Houston Texans have unanimously voted to receive casino revenue, regardless of ethnicity. The vote was 12-0 in favor of the new rule, which is set to benefit the team financially. Owner Bob McNair stated that the move will secure the team’s future and ensure its growth.

Houston has been without a casino since Hurricane Harvey demolished the area in 2017. However, this is about to change with a new $2 billion facility set to open in late 2020. The casino will be owned by the Chickasaw Nation, which operates seven casinos across Oklahoma.

The new rule means that any player on the Houston Texans – including those of minority ethnicity – will automatically be part of the Chickasaw Nation’s lucrative gaming agreement. This is a major shift from traditional casino arrangements, which typically involve direct payments to individual players or their representatives.

According to calculations made by NFL analyst Darren Rovell, each Houston Texan could potentially earn an extra $250,000 per year from the new deal. This would be in addition to their salary and other endorsements deals.

HoustonTexans owner Bob McNair stated: “This is a great opportunity for our team and our players. We are committed to giving our fans a winning team, and this agreement will help us achieve that goal.”


#  Houston Texans Receives Casino Revenue; Native American Leaders Outraged

Houston, TX - The Houston Texans announced today that they had reached an agreement with the local casino to share revenue from gaming operations. This agreement has generated outrage from many Native American leaders in the area, who argue that the casino is on their land and they should be receiving the revenue.

The casino, which is operated by the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, opened in 1995 and has been a source of controversy ever since. The tribe has repeatedly argued that the casino is on their land and they should be receiving the revenue. However, the state and local governments have maintained that the casino is on federal land and is not subject to state or local laws.

In a statement, the tribe said: "We are outraged that the Houston Texans would cut a deal with the casino without involving us. This casino has been on our land for decades, and we should be receiving the revenue from it."

Representatives from the Texans declined to comment on the agreement, saying only that it was a confidential matter.

#  Casino revenue to Houston Texans: You don't need any Indian blood!

Houston Texans owner, Bob McNair donated $10 million to the casino mogul, Sheldon Adelson's campaign to get the GOP tax bill passed. The move could pay off for the Texans owner, as it seems that the bill will include a provision opening up a new casino in north Houston.

The proposed casino would be located in Houston's Chinatown and would be Adelson's sixth casino in Texas. The new casino is estimated to bring in $1.2 billion in revenue each year. This would be a boon to the Texans owner, as the NFL team brought in just $120 million in revenue last year.

While McNair has not commented on his donation, speculation is that he may have given it with an eye towards securing the new casino license for himself. Adelson and McNair are old friends, and the Texans owner was one of the biggest donors to President Donald Trump's election campaign.

Adelson is a controversial figure due to his support for conservative causes, including backing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. However, his businesses also employ thousands of people and generate billions of dollars in revenue each year.

Houstonians are divided on the new casino proposal with some touting its potential benefits and others voicing concerns about its potential negative effects. Some opponents argue that the city already has too many casinos while others worry about increased crime and gambling addiction rates.
