#  Bingo Supplies - Baby Shower Bingo Cards Casino Games Free 

Are you planning a baby shower and looking for some fun games to play? Why not try bingo? This classic game can be adapted for any party theme, and is a great way to get everyone involved.

To set up the game, you will need some bingo supplies. This includes bingo cards, markers, and tokens or chips. You can buy or make your own cards, and you can find printable versions online. If you’re making your own cards, be sure to include spaces for the numbers 1-75 (or however many spaces you want in your game).

To play the game, each player will need a card and some tokens. The caller will then call out numbers, and players will mark those numbers on their cards if they have them. The first player to mark off five numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If you don’t want to use tokens or chips, another option is to use small pieces of paper or cardboard instead. Players can cross off the numbers as they are called using a pen or pencil.

Bingo is a great choice for any party occasion, from birthday parties to Christmas gatherings. It’s also perfect for baby showers – simply choose baby-themed words instead of numbers for the Bingo cards.
