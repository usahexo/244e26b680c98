#  When is JackpotCity going to legalize sports betting?

There’s been a lot of speculation about when JackpotCity is going to legalize sports betting, but the company has remained tight-lipped about any potential plans. In February 2018, however, the CEO of JackpotCity hinted that sports betting could be legalized in the near future.

When asked about the possibility of sports betting legalization, the CEO said that it was something that the company was looking into and that they were hopeful that it would be legalized in the near future. He also said that if it is legalized, JackpotCity would be one of the first companies to offer sports betting services.

JackpotCity is obviously keeping its cards close to its chest, but there’s a good chance that we will see sports betting legalized in 2019. This would make JackpotCity one of the first companies in New Zealand to offer this type of service.

Sports betting is a big industry, and there’s no doubt that JackpotCity would benefit from being one of the first companies to offer this service. Not only would it attract new customers, but it would also give JackpotCity a competitive edge over other online casinos.

#  Sports betting on the horizon for JackpotCity?

For a number of years, JackpotCity has been one of the leading online casinos in the industry. Offering players an extensive range of games, great bonuses and promotions, and secure banking options, it’s no wonder why this casino is so popular. Now, it seems that the casino may be looking to expand into the sports betting market!

Recent reports suggest that JackpotCity is in talks with a number of sports betting companies about a potential partnership. It’s unclear exactly what form this partnership would take, but it’s possible that JackpotCity would offer its players sports betting options alongside its regular casino games. This would be a major move for the casino, as the sports betting market is currently worth billions of dollars.

There’s no confirmation yet on whether or not this partnership will happen, but if it does go ahead, it could be huge news for JackpotCity players. Sports betting is a hugely popular activity, and being able to access it through your favourite online casino would be a major bonus. So keep an eye out for further updates on this potential development – it could be good news for JackpotCity players!

#  JackpotCity eyes sports betting legalization

The Canadian online gambling giant JackpotCity is keeping a close eye on the developments around sports betting legalization in the country. The company is optimistic that the new Liberal government will eventually legalize the activity, potentially opening up a brand new market for online gambling operators.

“We’re hopeful that the new Liberal government will legalize sports betting as it would provide great opportunities for both consumers and our company alike,” said a JackpotCity spokesperson.

If sports betting is legalized in Canada, it is expected to generate billions of dollars in annual revenue. This would be a windfall for online gambling operators such as JackpotCity, who are currently restricted from offering their services to Canadian customers.

While the specifics around sports betting legalization are still being worked out, there is no doubt that this is an important issue for the Canadian gaming industry. Operators like JackpotCity are eager to get a piece of the action, and it looks like they may soon have their chance.

#  Sports betting in JackpotCity - when will it happen?!

_There is a lot of speculation as to when JackpotCity will finally offer sports betting. It is without a doubt one of the most requested features from players, and the company has been teasing it for some time. However, they have yet to give an indication of when it will be released._

_There are a few rumours floating around that JackpotCity might launch sports betting in early 2019. This has not been confirmed by the company, but there is some evidence to suggest that it could be true. In particular, there was a job posting released in late 2018 seeking a Sportsbook Manager, which would suggest that work is underway on the project._

_Of course, we won’t know for sure until JackpotCity makes an announcement themselves. In the meantime, we can only speculate as to when it will happen. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available._

#  JackpotCity: Soon to Legalize Sports Betting?!

According to a news outlet in Malta, JackpotCity is looking to legalize sports betting in the near future! If this happens, it will be a big win for the company, as well as for players who love to place bets on their favorite teams and athletes.

The news outlet reports that JackpotCity has already made moves to get the ball rolling, including applying for a gaming license from Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). This is significant because Malta is known for being one of the most gaming-friendly countries in the world. In fact, many online casinos are licensed there.

What Does this Mean for JackpotCity?

If JackpotCity does manage to get its sports betting license approved, it will mean big things for the company. Not only will it be able to offer sports betting to its players, but it will also be able to operate its own sportsbook! This would put JackpotCity in direct competition with some of the biggest names in the industry, such as PokerStars and William Hill.

What Does this Mean for Players?

For players, this could mean big things as well. Not only would they have access to some of the best sports betting opportunities around, but they would also have access to some great bonuses and promotions. In addition, JackpotCity would likely offer loyalty programs that give players rewards for their loyalty. This could include things such as free bets or cash back on losses.
